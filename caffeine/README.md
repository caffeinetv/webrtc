Caffeine RTC
============

This library implements the WebRTC interfaces necessary to set up transmission to Caffeine.tv and presents a highly simplified C interface for easy integration into streaming software.

The intention is to have this project live outside of the WebRTC source tree with WebRTC as a dependency. The current layout came from a "just get it working" approach. See the https://github.com/caffeinetv/caffeine-rtc repo for more details.

The C API is defined in caffeine.h. This is still experimental and subject to change.
